#+TITLE: Weather Data Dashboard

This project is a Python-based application that visualizes weather data, including temperature and rain information for various cities. The application connects to a PostgreSQL database to fetch and display the data.

* Features
- Fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.
- Stores weather data in a PostgreSQL database.
- Visualizes temperature and rain data using Seaborn and Matplotlib.

* Requirements
- Python 3.6 or higher
- PostgreSQL
- Required Python packages:
  - requests
  - psycopg2
  - pandas
  - seaborn
  - matplotlib

You can install the required packages using pip:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
pip install requests psycopg2 pandas seaborn matplotlib
#+END_SRC

* Setup
1. **Create a PostgreSQL Database**:
   - Create a new PostgreSQL database to store the weather data.

2. **Get OpenWeatherMap API Key**:
   - Sign up at [[https://openweathermap.org/][OpenWeatherMap]] and obtain an API key.

3. **Create a Configuration File**:
   - Create a `config.json` file in the project directory with the following structure:

#+BEGIN_SRC json
{
    "api_key": "YOUR_OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY",
    "db_config": {
        "dbname": "your_db_name",
        "user": "your_username",
        "password": "your_password",
        "host": "localhost",
        "port": "5432"
    },
    "cities": ["City1", "City2", "City3"]
}
#+END_SRC

   Replace the placeholders with your actual database credentials and the list of cities you want to fetch weather data for.

4. **Run the Data Collection Script**:
   - Run the main script to fetch and store weather data in the database:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
python your_script_name.py
#+END_SRC

* Usage
- The application displays a table of weather data, including temperature and rain information for the specified cities.
- It provides visualizations for temperature by city and highlights cities currently experiencing rain.
